# CisRF

Thank you for your interest in CisRF!

# Data
Gene matrices of 201 regulatory elements*414 tissue samples were used to train CisRF. An example matrix of a gene used to train CisRF is included in the Data Folder.

# Usage
CisRF can be used to predict how a SNP will perturb regulatory element activity and change context-dependent gene expression. 

# CisRF Shiny
An interactive user interface was developed using R Shiny. Users may visualize CisRF's predictions, such as which contexts will exhibit the greatest gene expression change upon perturbation via SNP.
